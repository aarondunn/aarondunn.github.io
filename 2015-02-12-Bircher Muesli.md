**Ingredients**  
1/4 cup toasted sunflower seeds  
1 cup flaked almonds, toasted  
1 cup fresh raspberries  
1 cup fresh blueberries  
2 cups rolled oats  
1 cup natural Greek yoghurt  
1/2 cup milk  
1 1/2 cups natural apple juice  
2 green apples, grated  

Mix all ingredients except the apples together and store in a sealed container in the fridge over night. In the morning add grated apple, and an extra splash of milk or juice to achieve the texture that appeals most to you. Packed with oaty soluble fibre and vitamin loaded fruit, this is healthy, filling and delicious! Serves 6-8
