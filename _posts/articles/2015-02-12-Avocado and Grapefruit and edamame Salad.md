Avocado and Grapefruit and edamame Salad

![srgsg4grdgdr.jpg](srgsg4grdgdr.jpg)

For the Salad:

about 2 cups leafy greens

1 grapefruit, segmented

1 blood orange, segmented

1 cup shelled edamame

2 celery stalks, sliced

1 small (or half of a large) ripe avocado, peeled and sliced

For the Dressing:

3 tablespoons finely diced shallots

1 tablespoon honey (for vegans substitute a bit of agave)

1 tablespoon dijon or whole grain mustard

2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil

sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper

In a medium bowl, combine all of the salad ingredients:  greens, citrus segments, edamame, celery, and avocado.

In a small jar with a tight-fitting lid combine shallots, honey, mustard, vinegar, olive oil, a pinch of salt, and a few pinches of pepper.  Place the lid on the jar and shake it up until the mixture is emulsified. Taste the dressing and season to taste, adding more salt, pepper, or acid as necessary.  Pour the dressing (as much as youâ€™d life) over the salad.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
