**Ingredients**  
1 kg Jersey Royal potatoes  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
sea salt  
freshly ground black pepper  
2 sprigs rosemary, leaves picked and bashed  

**Method**  

Wash your potatoes and parboil until almost tender. When done, drain them, drizzle with just a little touch of olive oil and roll in a teaspoon of sea salt, a little freshly ground black pepper and the rosemary. 

Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7. Put the potatoes in a roasting tray and cook in the oven for 25 minutes until golden. Or wrap them in tin-foil and throw them on the barbie for the same amount of time.
