Ingredients
500g okra  
5 tbsp olive oil  
2 garlic cloves, crushed  
1 knob of fresh ginger (about 12g), finely chopped  
¼ tsp dried chilli flakes  
3 large ripe tomatoes, finely chopped  
2 tsp caster sugar  
1½ tbsp coriander leaves  
salt and pepper  

You either love it or hate it? Not totally so. This okra dish should convert some stubborn okra haters. Okra can be slimy but here that is minimised by removing the stalks carefully, without exposing the gloopy seeds, and by baking the okra whole rather than stewing it. The gingery sauce is light and clean.

Serves 2-4

Method

1. Preheat oven to 200C. To prepare okra, take a small sharp knife and carefully remove the stalk end. Try not to cut very low; leave the end of teh stalk to seal the main body of the fruit, so the seeds are not exposed.
2. Mix the okra with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and some salt and pepper. Scatter in a roasting tray in a single layer, then place in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, until just tender.
3. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. Heat the remaining oil in a large saucepan, add the garlic, ginger and chilli flakes and fry for about a minute. Add the tomatoes, sugar and some salt and pepper and cook, uncovered, over a medium heat for 10 minutes, until the mixture thickens slightly.
4. When the okra is ready, stir it gently into the sauce and cook for 2 minutes. To serve warm, spoon the okra on to serving plates and scatter the coriander on top. If serving at room temperature, adjust the seasoning again before serving and garnish with the coriander.
