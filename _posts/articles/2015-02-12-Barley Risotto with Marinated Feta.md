Ingredients    
1 cup / 200 g pearl barley  
2 Tbsp / 30 g unsalted butter (I used Earth Balance)  
6 Tbsp / 90 ml olive oil (separated)  
2 small celery stalks, cut into 1/4-inch / 0.5 cm dice  
2 small shallots, cut into 1/4-inch / 0.5 cm dice  
4 cloves garlic, minced  
4 thyme sprigs  
1/2 tsp smoked paprika  
1 bay leaf  
4 strips lemon peel  
1/4 tsp chile flakes   
one (14 oz / 400 g) can chopped tomatoes (I used diced fire-roasted)   
scant 3 cups / 700 ml vegetable stock  
1 1/4 cups / 300 ml passata*** (sieved crushed tomatoes)  
1 Tbsp caraway seeds  
10 1/2 oz / 300 g feta cheese broken into roughly 3/4-inch / 2 cm pieces  
1 Tbsp fresh oregano leaves  
salt and black pepper to taste  

***Passata: This was my first experience with passata which basically is just fresh tomatoes "passed" through a sieve or food mill to remove all seeds and lumps. For giggles, I look for it in the Italian section of my local gourmet grocery and found a big glass bottle from the Primo brand. I decided to try it but you could easily make your own or Pomi makes a strained tomato puree that is the same thing--just tomatoes strained smooth, nothing more.   


This vegetarian main course is a dish everybody loves, particularly children. Unlike the proper Italian risotto, ours does not require the exact precision and meticulous preparation, but still tastes sensational. 


Rinse the pearl barley well under cold water and leave to drain.

Melt the butter and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a very large frying pan and cook the celery, shallots, and garlic over gentle heat for 5 minutes until soft. Add the barley, thyme, paprika, bay leaf, lemon peel, chile flakes, tomatoes, stock, passata, and salt. Stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a very gentle simmer and cook for 45 minutes, stirring frequently to make sure the risotto does not catch on the bottom of the pan. When ready, the barley should be tender and most of the liquid absorbed.

Meanwhile, toast the caraway seeds in a dry pan for a couple of minutes. Then lightly crush them so that some whole seeds remain. Add them to the feta with the remaining 4 tablespoons /60 ml olive oil and gently mix to combine.

Once the risotto is ready, check the seasoning and then divide it among four shallow bowls. Top each with the marinated feta, including the oil, and a sprinkling of oregano leaves.
