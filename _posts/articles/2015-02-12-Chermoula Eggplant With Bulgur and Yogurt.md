Chermoula is a mixture of spices used in North African cooking, often to season fish. Here it’s rubbed over eggplant, which is then roasted and topped with a Middle Eastern salad of bulgur wheat and herbs, something like tabbouleh. “It’s a hybrid that could only happen in Jerusalem,” said Yotam Ottolenghi, an author of the new “Jerusalem” cookbook.

INGREDIENTS  
2 cloves garlic, crushed  
2 teaspoons ground cumin  
2 teaspoons ground coriander  
1 teaspoon chili flakes  
1 teaspoon sweet paprika  
2 tablespoons finely chopped preserved lemon peel (available in stores)  
⅔ cup olive oil, plus extra to finish  
2 medium eggplants  
1 cup fine bulgur  
⅔ cup boiling water  
⅓ cup golden raisins  
3 ½ tablespoons warm water  
⅓ ounce (2 teaspoons) cilantro, chopped, plus extra to finish  
⅓ ounce (2 teaspoons) mint, chopped  
⅓ cup pitted green olives, halved  
⅓ cup sliced almonds, toasted  
3 green onions, chopped  
1 ½ tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice  
½ cup Greek yogurt  
 Salt  
 
 PREPARATION
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

To make the chermoula, mix together in a small bowl the garlic, cumin, coriander, chili, paprika, preserved lemon, two-thirds of the olive oil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise. Score the flesh of each half with deep, diagonal crisscross cuts, making sure not to pierce the skin. Spoon the chermoula over each half, spreading it evenly, and place the eggplant halves on a baking sheet, cut side up. Put in the oven and roast for 40 minutes, or until the eggplants are completely soft.

Meanwhile, place the bulgur in a large bowl and cover with the boiling water.

Soak the raisins in the warm water. After 10 minutes, drain the raisins and add them to the bulgur, along with the remaining oil. Add the herbs, olives, almonds, green onions, lemon juice and a pinch of salt and stir to combine. 

Taste and add more salt if necessary.

Serve the eggplants warm or at room temperature. Place 1/2 eggplant, cut side up, on each individual plate. Spoon the bulgur on top, allowing some to fall from both sides. 

Spoon over some yogurt, sprinkle with cilantro and finish with a drizzle of oil.
