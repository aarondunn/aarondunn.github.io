This relatively simple Sephardic dish yields many layers of comforting flavours. The corn salad that follows it makes a perfect match. If you have a pan that's wide enough to hold the whole chicken flat, butterfly the bird by cutting through the centre of the breast until it opens up (or ask a butcher to do it for you). Serves four.

Ingredients  
1 tbsp sunflower oil  
1 small free-range chicken (about 1.5kg), butterflied or quartered  
1 tsp sweet paprika  
¼ tsp ground turmeric  
¼ tsp sugar  
Salt and black pepper  
2½ tbsp lemon juice  
1 large onion, peeled and quartered  
Sunflower oil, for frying  
25 garlic cloves, unpeeled  
750g charlotte potatoes, peeled, washed and cut into 2cm dice  

Pour the oil into a large, shallow pan or casserole and place on a high heat. Lay the chicken flat in the pan, skin-side down, and sear for four to five minutes, until golden-brown. Season all over with the paprika, turmeric, sugar, a third of a teaspoon of salt, some pepper and a tablespoon and a half of lemon juice.

Turn over the chicken, add the onion and cover the pot with a lid. Reduce the heat to low and leave for 30 minutes, occasionally checking the amount of juice at the bottom of the pan: add a little water, if needed, so there's always around 5mm.

After the chicken has been cooking for 30 minutes, pour sunflower oil into a medium saucepan so that it comes 3cm up the sides. Bring up to medium-high heat and fry the garlic and potatoes in batches for about six minutes, until they take on some colour. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt, and repeat with the remaining potatoes and garlic.

After the chicken has been cooking for an hour, lift the bird from the pan and stir the potatoes and garlic into the cooking juices. Put the chicken on top of the potatoes and cook for another 30 minutes, by which time the meat should be falling off the bone. When serving, drizzle with a little fresh lemon juice.
