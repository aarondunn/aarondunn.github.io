Ingredients

A heaping cup of dried chickpeas  
2 tbsp olive oil, divided  
1 onion, finely chopped  
1 tsp cumin seeds  
1 tsp coriander seeds  
1 tbsp tomato paste  
1 tin diced tomatoes  
1 tsp sugar  
1 1/2 tsp ground cumin  
100 g baby spinach leaves  
coriander to garnish  
salt and black pepper  
2 large sweet potatoes  
700 ml water  
1/2 tbsp unsalted butter  
4 tbsp honey  
1/2 tsp salt  
170g Greek yogurt  
1 garlic clove, crushed
juice and grated zest of one lemon  
1 tsp dried mint  

Don’t be put off by what may seem like a carbohydrate overkill. The soft, warm sweet potato almost melts over the chickpeas, while the yoghurt sauce lightens them with its velvety smoothness. The result is an extremely satisfying vegetarian main course. In her book, Amaretto, Apple Cake and Artichokes (Vintage, 2006), Anna Del Conte suggests adding a paste of bicarbonate of soda, flour and salt to chickpeas when soaking them, in order to soften very hard
skins. (We can’t recommend this book enough for the most thorough introduction to Italian ingredients and methods.) In most cases bicarbonate of soda alone does the trick. No matter what you do, you will need to soak chickpeas for at least 12 hours and up to 24 before cooking them.
