2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for brushing  
1 tbsp coarse sea salt

1½ tsp active dried yeast (or 15g fresh yeast)  
420ml bottled still spring water, lukewarm  
330g strong white bread flour  

Parsley and olive topping:  
2 tbsp olive oil  
1 garlic clove, crushed  
30g flat-leaf parsley, chopped  
50g kalamata olives, pitted  
coarse sea salt  

Grape and fennel seed topping:  
300g seedless red grapes  
50g caster sugar

1 small red onion, thinly sliced  
2 tbsp olive oil  
100g goat’s cheese, crumbled

Soft, rich and chewy, focaccia is our favourite when sipping a glass of wine before a meal. It is perfect with crumbly mature Parmesan. Jim Webb, who tried the book’s sweet and baking recipes and played a huge part in their creation, always emphasises the importance of not overdoing the topping. Focaccia isn’t a fat pizza but a bread, enriched with oil and some flavouring. Just make sure to use the best olive oil and be generous with it. The grape focaccia might seem unusual but it goes wonderfully well with cheese. Try it with a mature Taleggio. Or, since the oil gives focaccia a prolonged life, have it the next day for breakfast, like a good Danish pastry.

Method:
Starter/Preferment  
For the starter put the yeast and water in a large mixing bowl and stir until the yeast dissolves. Add the flour and stir until there is a porridge like consistency. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and leave somewhere warm for about an hour until it has doubled in size. {will take longer in winter}.

Thermomix: Place starter ingredients in bowl of TM, mix at Speed 6 for 30seconds. Cover and leave in a warm place until doubled in size.
Dough

Mix the starter with the flour, sugar and olive oil. Knead for about six minutes, then add the salt and knead further until the salt is mixed through.

Thermomix: Place starter and remaining dough ingredients in bowl of TM, mix at Speed 6 for 30seconds, then knead for 4 minutes.

Brush a large bowl with oil, place the dough in it and brush the surface of the dough with more oil. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and leave in a warm place for one hour or until the dough has again doubled in size.

Turn the dough on to a floured bench and stretch and flatten it into a rectangle. Take one of the short ends of the rectangle and fold it into the centre, take the other end and fold it over the first one to form three layers of dough.{I added olives and lots of garlic into the layers too}
Brush a heavy baking tray {around 30cm x 40cm} with oil. Lift the dough on to the tray and flatten it by pressing hard with your hands. Cover with cling film and leave to rise for another hour. During this time check on the dough a couple of times and press it down, spreading it to the edges of the tray.

Preheat the oven to 220C. Press the olives and rosemary into the top of the focaccia and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake in the oven for 10 mins and then reduce the heat to 190C and continue for 15-20 mins or until golden. When it is out of the oven and still hot brush with plenty of olive oil.
