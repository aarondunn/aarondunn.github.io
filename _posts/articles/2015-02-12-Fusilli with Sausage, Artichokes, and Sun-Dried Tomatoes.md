![s4t4sg4st4h5.jpg](s4t4sg4st4h5.jpg)

Ingredients

3/4 cup drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, sliced, reserve oil  
3/4 pound ground meat (lean turkey) or sausages (hot italian, chicken, merguez lamb, etc.), casings removed - Cajun chicken is delicious!  
16 oz canned artichoke hearts  
1 onion, chopped  
2 bunches chard, chopped (leaves and stems separately)  
1 container mushrooms, chopped  
2 large cloves garlic, chopped  
1 lemon, juiced  
1/2 cup dry white wine  
1 tsp Paprika  
1 tsp Chili powder  
16 ounces fusilli (or rigatoni) pasta  
1 cup chopped fresh basil leaves  
3/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves  
Salt and freshly ground pepper  
Parmesan (optional)  

1. Heat the oil reserved from the sun-dried tomatoes in a heavy large frying pan over medium-high heat.

2. Add the ground meat/sausages and cook until brown, breaking up the meat into bite-size pieces with a fork, about 8 minutes.

3. Add the onion and chard stems and brown. Add the mushrooms and brown.

4. Add the chard leaves, sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke, and garlic and saute until tender.

5. Add the lemon juice, wine, and spices. Cook until sauce thickens.

6. Add the herbs (parsley, basil, etc.).

6. Season with salt and pepper as needed. 

7. Cook the pasta.

Toss the sauce with the pasta. (parmesan is optional)
