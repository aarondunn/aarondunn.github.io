1 quantity of Shortcrust pastry (see page 281 or use 500g bought pastry)
vegetable oil for brushing the tin

Serves four.

300g white flour  
180g cold butter  
½ tsp salt  
50ml water  
1 egg yolk  
400g Jerusalem artichokes, peeled  
4 tbsp olive oil  
250g chard leaves  
½ tsp fresh rosemary, chopped  
Juice of ½ lemon  
1 garlic clove, crushed  
Salt and pepper  
220g double cream  
50g crème fraîche  
2 medium eggs  
150g feta, broken in to pieces  

Rub together the flour, butter and salt to a crumble. Add the water and egg yolk, and mix until it comes together. Cover with clingfilm and chill for an hour. Roll the pastry 2-3mm thick, then line an oiled 24cm loose-based tart tin. Rest in the fridge for half an hour. Preheat the oven to 170C/325F/gas mark 3. Blind bake the tart case, using silicon paper and baking beans, for 15-20 minutes - it should get a bit of colour but not cook through.

Cut the artichokes into 2cm cubes, boil in salted water for 15 minutes and drain. Chop the chard leaves and stalk, heat the oil, add the stalks and, after a minute, the leaves and rosemary, and sauté for about five minutes. Off the heat, stir in the lemon, garlic and seasoning.

Whisk the creams and eggs with a little salt and pepper. Spread the vegetables and feta in the tart case, then pour in the cream mix. Bake for 15 minutes, then cover with foil and bake for another 45 minutes, until set.
