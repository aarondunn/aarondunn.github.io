One of my favourite recipes. Serve at room temperature with a chunk of bread. Serves four.

3 tbsp olive oil  
2 medium onions, peeled and cut into 1cm slices  
1 tbsp coriander seeds  
3 peppers (a mix of yellow and red), cut into 1cm slices  
2 garlic cloves, crushed  
3 bay leaves  
2 tomatoes, chopped  
1½ tbsp curry powder  
1½ tbsp sugar  
3 tbsp cider vinegar  
Salt and black pepper  
500g pollock fillet (or other white fish), cut into four pieces  
Seasoned flour, for dusting  
1 large egg, beaten  
20g chopped coriander  

Heat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3. Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large sauté pan or casserole that will fit in the oven. Add the onions and coriander seeds, and cook on medium heat for three minutes, stirring often. Add the peppers, cook for five minutes, then add the garlic, bay, tomatoes and curry powder. Cook for eight minutes, stirring occasionally, then add the sugar, vinegar, a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper, and cook for five minutes.

Heat the remaining oil in another frying pan. Dip the fish first in flour and then in egg, and fry for three minutes, turning once. Transfer the fish to the pepper pan and add 150ml water, so it's just coated by the vegetables and some liquid.

Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the fish is cooked, then remove and leave to come to room temperature. The fish can be served at this point, but it's better after a day or two in the fridge. Serve garnished with coriander.
