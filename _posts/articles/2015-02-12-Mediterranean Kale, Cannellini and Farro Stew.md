Ingredients  
2 Tbsp olive oil  
1 cup carrots diced (about 2 medium)  
1 cup chopped yellow onion (1 small)  
1 cup chopped celery (about 2)  
4 cloves garlic, minced  
1 (32 oz) carton low-sodium vegetable broth  
1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes  
1 cup farro, rinsed  
1 tsp dried oregano  
1 bay leaf  
Salt, to taste  
1/2 cup slightly packed parsley sprigs (stems included)  
4 cups slightly packed chopped kale, thick ribs removed  
1 (15 oz) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed  
1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice  
Feta cheese, crumbled, for serving  


Directions

Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add carrots, onion and celery and saute 3 minutes. Add garlic and saute 30 seconds longer. Stir in vegetable broth, tomatoes, farro, oregano, bay leaf and season with salt to taste. Lay parsley in a mound on top of soup and bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat just below medium. Cover and cook 20 minutes, then remove parsley, stir in kale and cook 10 - 15 minutes longer, adding in cannellini beans during last few minutes of cooking, until both farro and kale are tender.

Remove bay leaf, stir in lemon juice and add additional vegetable broth or some water to thin soup as desired (the farro will absorb more liquid as the soup rests). Serve warm topping each serving with feta cheese.
