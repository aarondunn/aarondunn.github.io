INGREDIENTS  
scant 1 cup / 200 g Greek yogurt  
3/4 cup plus 2 tbsp / 200 ml whole milk  
2 large stale Turkish flatbread or naan (9 oz /250 g in total)  
3 large tomatoes (13 oz /380 g in total), cut into 2/3-inch / 1.5cm dice  
3 oz / 100 g radishes, thinly sliced  
3 Lebanese or mini cucumbers (9 oz / 250 g in total), peeled and chopped into 2/3-inch / 1.5cm dice  
2 green onions, thinly sliced  
1/2 oz / 15 g fresh mint  
scant 1 oz / 25 g flat-leaf parsley, coarsely chopped  
1 tbsp dried mint  
2 cloves garlic, crushed  
3 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice  
1/4 cup / 60 ml olive oil, plus extra to drizzle  
2 tbsp cider or white wine vinegar  
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste  
1 teaspoon fine grain sea salt, plus more to taste  
1 tbsp sumac or more to taste, to garnish  

Try to get small cucumbers for this as for any other fresh salad. They are worlds apart from the large ones we normally get in most UK supermarkets. You could skip the fermentation stage and use buttermilk instead of the combination of milk and yoghurt. For a typical chopped salad, try the Spiced chickpeas and fresh vegetable salad, page 56, omitting the sugar and the chickpeas.

1. If using yogurt and milk, start at least 3 hours and up to a day in advance by
placing both in a bowl. Whisk well and leave in a cool place or in the fridge
until bubbles form on the surface. What you get is a kind of homemade buttermilk, but less sour.

2. Tear the bread into bite-size pieces and place in a large mixing bowl. Add
your fermented yogurt mixture or commercial buttermilk, followed by the rest
of the ingredients, mix well, and leave for 10 minutes for all the flavors to
combine.

3. Spoon the fattoush into serving bowls, drizzle with some olive oil, and garnish generously with sumac.
