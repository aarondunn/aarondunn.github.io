Ingredients:
4 organic salmon fillets, weighing 200g each  
2 tbsp olive oil  
salt and pepper  

Red pepper and hazelnut salsa:  
2 red peppers  
6 tbsp olive oil  
15g hazelnuts   
15g chives, chopped  
1 garlic clove, crushed  
juice and grated zest of 1 lemon  
2 tbsp cider vinegar   

You can prepare this simple dish in minutes if you make the salsa the day before and store it in the fridge; just remember to let it come back to room temperature before serving. Peeling the peppers is a chore you can choose to avoid if you are feeling lazy. The sauce will not be quite as smooth but it will still taste fantastic.

Serves 4  

Method
For the Salsa

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C.
2. Quarter the peppers and remove the seeds. Toss with olive oil and
sprinkle with salt. Place on a baking tray and roast for about 20
minutes until cooked through and slightly charred. Transfer to a bowl,
cling film and leave to cool keeping any roasting juices.
3. Roast the hazelnuts on a separate baking tray for 10 minutes or until
lightly coloured. Allow them to cool. Rub them between your hands to
remove the skins then chop up roughly. 
4. When cool, peel and dice the peppers. Mix with the hazelnuts, olive oil,
crushed garlic, chives, lemon juice and zest and cider vinegar and
season well.
5. Leave a ridged griddle pan over the highest heat possible for a few
minutes until it is very hot. Line an oven tray with baking parchment.
Brush the salmon fillets with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Place them on a hot griddle pan, skin side up, and cook for about 3
minutes.
6. Remove from the griddle pan and place the fillets skin side down on
the lined baking tray. Bake for 5 – 8 minutes until the salmon is cooked
but is still a light pink on the inside. Serve warm with a large spoonful of
salsa on top.
