CRUST

Time: 15 minutes, plus one hour chilling 

Yield: One 9-inch single pie crust

Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour  
1/4 teaspoon salt  
8 tablespoons (4oz) unsalted butter, preferably a high-fat, European-style butter like Plugra, chilled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces keep cold  
1 tablespoon (2oz) lard  
2 to 5 tablespoons ice water  

Method:

In a food processor, briefly pulse together the flour and salt. Add butter and pulse until mixture forms chickpea-size pieces (3 to 5 one-second pulses). Add ice water one tablespoon at a time, and pulse until mixture is just moist enough to hold together.

Form dough into a ball, wrap with plastic and flatten into a disk. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before rolling out and baking.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out pie crust to a 12-inch circle. Transfer crust to a 9-inch pie plate. Fold over any excess dough, then crimp edges. Prick crust all over with a fork. If you have time, freeze crust for 15 to 30 minutes; otherwise skip this step.

Cover pie with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights, rice or dried beans. Bake for 15 minutes; remove foil and weights and bake until pale golden, 15 minutes more. Cool on rack until needed.

Yosses recommends pre-baking the crust. After the crust is filled (see below), bake again. The filling will prevent the crust from burning. Cover the exposed crust around the perimeter with aluminum foil if it's getting too dark.

FILLING

Ingredients:  
3/4 cup granulated sugar  
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger  
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves  
Â¼ tsp ground cardamom  
2 large eggs  
1 can (15 oz.) pumpkin pie filling  
1 can (12 fl. oz.) evaporated milk  

Method:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Mix sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, cloves, and cardamom in small bowl.

Beat eggs in large bowl. Stir in pumpkin and sugar-spice mixture. Gradually stir in evaporated milk. Pour into pie shell.

Bake for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. Reduce temperature to 325 degrees; bake in a water bath for 60-75 minutes, or until knife inserted near center comes out clean.

Cool on wire rack for 2 hours. Serve immediately or refrigerate.

Top with whipped cream before serving.
