Ingredients

Scant 1 cup/150 g wild rice  
Scant 1 1/4 cup/220 g basmati rice  
5 1/2 tbsp/80 ml olive oil  
2/3 cup/100 g quinoa  
6 1/2 tbsp/60 g almonds, skins on, coarsely chopped  
7 tbsp/60 g pine nuts  
1/4 cup/60 ml sunflower oil  
2 medium onions, thinly sliced (about 3 cups/320 g)  
1 cup/30 g flat-leaf parsley leaves, coarsely chopped  
2/3 cup/20 g basil leaves, coarsely chopped  
1/3 cup/10 g tarragon leaves, coarsely chopped  
2 cups/40 g arugula  
2/3 cup/80 g dried sour cherries  
1/4 cup/60 ml lemon juice, plus the grated zest of 1 lemon  
2 cloves garlic, crushed  
Salt and black pepper  

Procedures

1. Place the wild rice in a saucepan, cover with plenty of water, bring to a boil, and then turn down to a gentle simmer and cook for 35 minutes, until the rice is cooked but still firm. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside to dry.

2. Mix the basmati rice with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Place in a saucepan with 1 1/3 cups/ 330 ml of boiling water, cover, and cook over the lowest possible heat for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, place a tea towel over the pan, replace the lid, and set aside for 10 minutes. Uncover and allow to cool down completely.

3. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil and add the quinoa. Cook for 9 minutes, then drain into a fine sieve, refresh under cold water, and set aside.

4. Place the almonds and pine nuts in a small pan with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and a pinch of salt. Cook over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Transfer to a small plate as soon as the pine nuts begin to color and set aside.

5. Heat the sunflower oil in a large saut√© pan and add the onions, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and some black pepper. Cook over high heat for 5 to 8 minutes, stirring often, so that parts of the onion get crisp and others just soft. Transfer to paper towels to drain.

6. Place all the grains in a large bowl along with the chopped herbs, arugula, fried onion, nuts, and sour cherries. Add the lemon juice and zest, the remaining 3 1/2 tbsp olive oil, the garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and some pepper. Mix well and set aside for at least 10 minutes before serving.
