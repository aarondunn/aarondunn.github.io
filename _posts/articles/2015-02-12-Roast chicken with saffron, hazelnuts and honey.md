INGREDIENTS

1 large organic or free-range chicken, divided into quarters:  breast and wing, leg and thigh  
2 onions, coarsely chopped  
4 tablespoons olive oil  
1 teaspoon ground ginger  
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
A generous pinch of saffron threads  
Juice of 1 lemon  
4 tablespoons cold water  
2 teaspoons coarse sea salt  
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  
Scant 3/4 cup (100 g) unskinned hazelnuts  
3 1/2 tablespoons (70 g) honey  
2 tablespoons rose water  
2 green onions, coarsely chopped  

This dish is inspired by a recipe from Claudia Roden’s classic book, Tamarind and Saffron (Viking, 1999). It is one of our favourites: it is so easy to make, yet looks stunning, and has the most delicate and exotic combination of flavours (rosewater, saffron and cinnamon), which takes you straight to the famous Jamaa el Fna in Marrakech. Serve with rice or plain couscous.


Procedures

1. In a large bowl, mix the chicken pieces with the onions, olive oil, ginger, cinnamon, saffron, lemon juice, water, salt, and pepper.  Leave to marinate for at least an hour, or overnight in the fridge.

2. Preheat the oven to 375°F / 190°C. Spread the hazelnuts out  on a baking sheet and toast for 10 minutes, until lightly browned.  Chop coarsely and set aside.

3. Transfer the chicken and marinade to a baking sheet large enough  to accommodate everything comfortably. Arrange the chicken pieces skin side up and put the pan in the oven for about 35 minutes.

4. While the chicken is roasting, mix the honey, rose water, and nuts together to make a rough paste. Remove the chicken from the oven, spoon a generous amount of nut paste onto each piece, and spread  it to cover. Return to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the nuts are golden brown.

5. Transfer the chicken to a serving dish and garnish with the chopped green onions.
