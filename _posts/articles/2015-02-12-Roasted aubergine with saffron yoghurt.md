Ingredients  
3 medium aubergines, cut into slices 2cm thick, or into wedges (page 26)
olive oil for brushing
2 tbsp toasted pine nuts
a handful of pomegranate seeds
20 basil leaves
coarse sea salt and black pepper

Saffron yoghurt:
a small pinch of saffron strands
3 tbsp hot water
180g Greek yoghurt
1 garlic clove, crushed
2½ tbsp lemon juice
3 tbsp olive oil

This is probably the archetypal Ottolenghi salad: robust contrasting flavours, vibrant and vivacious colours, fresh herbs and nuts – laid out generously to reveal all of the dish’s elements. To create the most impact, we recommend that you serve it from a communal plate brought out to the dining table. It makes an exciting starter and doesn’t need much else beside it.

Serves 4

Start with the saffron yoghurt, you can make this well in advance and it will keep in the fridge for up to three days. Soak the saffron in the hot water for about five minutes till it has a nice yellow color. pour into a bowl with the yoghurt, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and some salt. Whisk together till it’s a smooth, golden yellow sauce and leave in the fridge till ready to serve.

Now pre heat the oven to 220 C. Put the slices of aubergine on to an oven grid, brush with olive oil on both sides and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast for about 20-35 minutes till golden brown. There seems to be a great variation in ovens because mine took only 15-20 minutes to get the same result. Keep an eye on the oven and you’ll be fine.
The roast aubergines will also keep for around three days in the fridge but let them reach room temperature before serving.
