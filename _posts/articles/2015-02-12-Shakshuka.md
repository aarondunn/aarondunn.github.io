Ingredients

2 Tbs. olive oil  
2 tsp. pilpelchuma or harissa  
2 tsp. tomato paste  
2 large red peppers, cut into ¼-inch dice  
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped  
1 tsp. ground cumin  
5 large, very ripe tomatoes, chopped (5 cups total); canned are also fine  
4 large eggs, plus 4 egg yolks  
1/2 cup labneh or thick yogurt  
1/4 tsp salt  

Instructions

Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat and all the pilpelcuma or harissa, tomato paste, peppers, garlic, cumin and ¼ tsp. salt.

Stir and cook over medium heat for about 8 miinutes to allow the peppers to soften. Add the tomatoes, bring to a gentle simmer and cook for a further 10 minutes until you have quite a thick sauce. Taste for seasoning.

Make 8 little dips in the sauce. Gently break the eggs and carefully pour each into its own dip. Do the same with the yolks. Use a fork to swirl the egg whites a little bit with the sauce, taking care not to break the yolks.

Simmer gently for 8 to 10 minutes until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny (you can cover the pan with a lid if you wish to hasten the process).

Remove from the heat, leave for a couple of minutes to settle, then spoon into individual plates and serve with the labneh or yogurt.
