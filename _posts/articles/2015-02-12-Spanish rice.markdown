Ingredients:

Serves: 6  

1 cup uncooked rice  
1 medium onion, chopped (I like onions so I used a large one)  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil (I used olive oil)  
2 1/2 cups water  
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce  
1 small green bell pepper, chopped  
1 1/2 teaspoons salt  
3/4 teaspoon chili powder  
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder  


Directions:

1. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat.

2. Add rice and onion and cook (about 5-10 minutes) stirring occasionally, until rice is golden brown and onion is tender.

3. Stir in remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.

4. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender.
