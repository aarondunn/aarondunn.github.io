100g dried chickpeas  
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda  
2 small cucumbers (280g in total)  
2 large tomatoes (300g in total)  
240g radishes  
1 red pepper, deseeded and white flesh removed  
1 small red onion, peeled  
20g coriander leaves and stems, roughly chopped  
15g flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped  
90ml olive oil  
grated zest of 1 lemon, plus 2 tbsp juice  
1 1/2 tbsp sherry vinegar  
1 garlic clove, crushed  
1 tsp caster sugar  
1 tsp ground cardamom  
1 1/2 tsp ground allspice  
1 tsp ground cumin  
Greek yogurt (optional)  
salt and black pepper  

The inspiration for this salad didn’t come directly from Jerusalem but rather from Morito, a wonderful London tapas bar owned and run by Samantha and Samuel Clark, whose food is inspired by southern

Spain, North Africa and the Middle East, very much echoing the same voices that can be heard in Jerusalem’s kitchens. The combination of the cold and fresh salad with the warm chickpeas is surprisingly enticing. You can serve this dish as it is, with just a thick, fresh pita. Still, a plate of Hummus (see page 134) alongside, or perhaps Cauliflower with tahini (see page 80) would complement it fantastically well. The salad also works on its own without the chickpeas (just omit the sugar).


Soak the chickpeas overnight in a large bowl of cold water and the bicarb. Next day, drain, place in a large pan and cover with twice the volume of water. Bring to a boil and simmer for an hour, skimming off any foam, until tender, then drain.

Cut the cucumber, tomato, onion, radish and pepper into 1cm dice, and mix with the coriander and parsley. In a jar or sealable container, put 75ml of olive oil with the lemon juice and zest, vinegar, garlic and sugar, shake and season to taste. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss lightly.

Mix together the cardamom, allspice, cumin and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and spread on a plate. Toss the cooked chickpeas in the spice mixture in batches, to coat well. Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan and over medium heat lightly fry the chickpeas for two to three minutes, gently shaking the pan so they cook evenly and don't stick. Keep warm.

Divide the salad between four plates, arranging it in a large circle with a slight indent in the middle, and spoon the warm chickpeas in the centre. Drizzle some Greek yoghurt on top if you prefer the salad to be a bit more creamy.
