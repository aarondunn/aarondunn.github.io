The creamy sumac sauce served with these burgers is fantastically sharp and will go well with most non-red meats (chicken sofrito, page 190, for example) and also with grilled vegetables and fritters. You can make it in advance, or double the quantity, and keep it refrigerated. After a day the flavours will mellow so you may want to reinvigorate it by adding extra sumac and lemon juice. The burgers are very portable. You can have them as a snack from the fridge and they are also ideal for taking over to friends or in a lunchbox for work.

Yield: about 9 small patties

Serving Size: 2-3 patties

Ingredients

for the burgers  
1 lb ground turkey (i used white meat, you can also use dark meat)  
1 large or 2 medium zucchini, grated (2 cups grated)  
3 green onions, sliced  
1 large egg, beaten  
2 Tbsp chopped fresh mint  
2 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro  
2 cloves garlic, minced  
1 tsp ground cumin  
1 tsp salt  
1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper  
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper  
oil for browing  
for the Sumac Sauce  
2/3 cup yogurt  
1/2 cup sour cream  
zest of 1 lemon  
juice of 1/2 lemon  
1 small clove garlic, minced  
1 1/2 tsp olive oil  
1 Tbsp sumac  
1/2 tsp salt  
1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper  

Instructions

Set oven to 425F
Make the sumac sauce by combining all the ingredients in a bowl and mixing well. 
Refrigerate until needed. Thin with a little water if you like a thinner sauce.

Put all the burger ingredients, except the oil, in a large bowl Mix well, using your hands, making sure to get all the ingredients well incorporated, but don't over-work the meat...use a light touch!

Form the meat mixture into patties. I used a 1/3 cup as a measure, and made about 9 burgers. (You can make your burgers as large or small as you like, but will need to adjust the cooking time.) Note that the mixture will be very wet. Don't worry, they will firm up as they cook.
Coat the bottom of a skillet lightly with oil and heat until it is nice and hot. You should hear a good sizzle when the patties hit the pan, If not, let the oil heat more. Working in batches, brown the patties on both sides, for about 2 minutes per side, and add more oil as needed.

Set the burgers on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for about 7 to 10 minutes, just until done inside.

Serve the burgers with the sauce.

Notes
You can make these any size you want, from a regular burger size, to smaller patties and even meatballs. Serve them on top of salad greens, in a bun, or pita bread. Recipe from Jerusalem
