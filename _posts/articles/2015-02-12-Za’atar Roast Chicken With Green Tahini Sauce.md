Za’atar Roast Chicken With Green Tahini Sauce
Because of the brothy marinade, the skin won’t get as crisp as with other roast chickens, but the flesh will be so tender, you’ll want to eat it with your hands.

Ingredients  
SERVINGS: 6  
Green Tahini Sauce  
2 cloves garlic, smashed  
1 cup (lightly packed) flat-leaf parsley leaves with tender stems  
½ cup tahini  
¼ cup fresh lemon juice  
Kosher salt  

Chicken And Assembly  
1 3½–4-lb. chicken, cut into quarters, or 2 large skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts and 2 skin-on, bone-in chicken legs  
2 medium red onions, thinly sliced  
2 cloves garlic smashed  
1 lemon, thinly sliced, seeds removed  
1 tablespoon ground sumac  
1½ teaspoon ground allspice  
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth or water  
¼ cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling  
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  
2 tablespoons za’atar  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
¼ cup pine nuts  
6 pieces lavash or other flatbread  

Ingredient Info  
Za’atar and sumac are available at Middle Eastern markets and specialty foods stores, and online.

Preparation

Green Tahini Sauce
Pulse garlic, parsley, tahini, lemon juice, and ½ cup water in a food processor, adding more water if needed, until smooth (sauce should be the consistency of a thin mayonnaise); season with salt.

DO AHEAD: Sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.

Chicken And Assembly
Preheat oven to 400°. Toss chicken, onions, garlic, lemon, sumac, allspice, cinnamon, broth, and ¼ cup oil in a large resealable plastic bag; season with salt and pepper. Chill at least 2 hours.

Place chicken, onions, garlic, and lemon on a rimmed baking sheet, spooning any remaining marinade over and around chicken. Sprinkle with za’atar and roast until chicken is browned and cooked through, 45–55 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add pine nuts and cook, stirring often, until butter foams, then browns, and nuts are golden brown (be careful not to burn), about 4 minutes; season with salt.
Slice chicken breasts, if desired. Serve chicken with roasted onion and lemon, topped with pine nuts, with green tahini sauce and lavash.
DO AHEAD: Chicken can be marinated 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.
