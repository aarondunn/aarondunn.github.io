Chicken noodle soup

![segs4ydgdrg.jpg](segs4ydgdrg.jpg)

1 tbsp olive oil 
1 tbsp butter 
1 brown onion, peeled and diced 
1 large or 2 small carrots, peeled, halved lengthwise and sliced 
1 sick celery, halved lengthwise and sliced (if small, just slice 2 stalks without halving) 
2 cloves garlic, crushed 
1/4 tsp ground cloves  
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 
100g fine noodles eg vermicelli or angel hair, snapped into 10cm long threads 
1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves, roughly torn  
1.2 litres good quality (preferably home-made) chicken stock 
2 fresh or 1 dried bay leaves  
2 cups left-over chicken, skin removed, shredded


Heat oil and butter in a large pot and cook onion, carrots, celery, garlic, cloves, salt and pepper over a medium/gentle heat for 15-20 minutes until soft but not coloured. Add stock and bay leaves. Bring to the boil, add chicken and noodles and simmer for about 5 minutes until noodles are cooked and chicken is heated through. Serve garnished with parsley and on the side, lightly toasted ciabatta or freshly made cheese scones (that's 'biscuits' to my American friends).
