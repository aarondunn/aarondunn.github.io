*Double ingredients

200g puy lentils
2 bay leaves
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 tbsp olive oil
100g pancetta, chopped
1/2 onion, peeled and finely chopped
1 stick celery, finely chopped
1 small carrot, finely chopped
1 small zucchini, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
pinch chilli flakes
1/2 cup chopped flat leaf parsley
a few basil leaves

1/2 cup basil pesto
2-4 eggs, fried or poached to your liking


Put lentils in a saucepan and cover (by at least 6 or 7cm) with cold water. Add bay leaves, bring to the boil then reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 20-25 minutes. Drain well,  rinse under cold running water and drain again and fold through vinegar.

In a large, deep frying pan heat olive oil and cook pancetta over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes until crispy and releasing it's fat. Add onion, celery, carrot and zucchini with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook 15 minutes over a gentle heat until the vegetables are softened. Add garlic and chilli with lentils and cook 2 minutes, then out aside. Poach or fry 2-4 eggs (depending on how eggy you want to get), give the lentils a final blat to heat through, stir through parsley and serve topped with basil, eggs and pesto, sea salt and a good grinding of black pepper. Serves 2, but can easily be multiplied to serve more.
