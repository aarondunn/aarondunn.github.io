Tomato Salad

![fs44shgdt5hddg.jpg](fs44shgdt5hddg.jpg)


3-4 tomatoes per person (depending on their sizes) at room temperature*
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 tbsp white balsamic vinegar
sea salt and black pepper
a handful of fresh basil leaves

*Please don't store those beautiful tomatoes in the fridge before they are ripe - use them as soon as they are perfect, or then store them in the fridge, but either way serve them at room temperature...as I'm sure you know cold things have less flavour :)
